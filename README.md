# My_Demo_form

##Description of this project
This is one of my first projects. As of june 2023 i'm learning HTML and CSS and i implemented these technologies in this project. As you can see the background of the page looks like the sky. To create it i just played around with linear-gradient. It's essentially a basic form that requests some straight forward info. I learned to create it with freecodecamp.
